## Classical cat states

A cat can have many states, we'll start by talking about various classical states a cat may have.
Since cats won't listen to you and get into the state you need for a good picture these wild cat
states will have to suffice.

A place where you can often find a cat is on a surface that you wanted to use, like a desk or a table
which makes this a very common state for the cat to be in as seen below here.

Cats may also try to seek out shelter at various moments of the day, good shelter includes boxes,
baskets and other things scattered about. As long as the cat is not expected to be there it's good
since the cat will be more hidden when on the hunt.

The last classical cat state I will talk about is what I'd call the "cuddle state". In this state
the cat feels safe and comfy enough to let you cuddle them maximally, their belly is out in the open
their paws are spread out and purring is quite common (at least in this specimen)

But classical cat states aren't the only type of cat state we consider, there's also a far
less useful (currently) type called a schr√∂dinger cat state.
